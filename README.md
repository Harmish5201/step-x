# Step-x

A webshop to purchase popular shoes
-> not really purachasable yet ;) 

This was a fun and very interesting project, built everything from scratch by myself using <strong>PHP</strong>, <strong>Javascript</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>HTML</strong> & <strong>MySQL</strong>. <br>
I also have aanother version using <strong>.json</strong> as database. However, it is not uploaded here.
